## RNA-Seq Analysis Pipelines

This repository contains pipelines for RNA-Seq analysis implemented in various languages and frameworks.

### Pipelines

#### Nextflow Pipeline

The Nextflow pipeline (nextflow/) is implemented using Nextflow, a domain-specific language for data-driven computational pipelines. It includes steps for quality control, trimming, alignment, and gene expression quantification.
For detailed instructions and usage information, please refer to the Nextflow README.

#### WDL Pipeline

The WDL pipeline (wdl/) is implemented using Workflow Description Language (WDL), a language for describing data analysis workflows. It includes steps for quality control, trimming, alignment, and gene expression quantification.
For detailed instructions and usage information, please refer to the WDL README.

#### Bash Pipeline

The Bash pipeline (bash/) is implemented as a bash script. It performs RNA-Seq analysis using native Linux tools and bash scripting. It includes steps for quality control, trimming, alignment, and gene expression quantification.
For detailed instructions and usage information, please refer to the Bash README.

### Usage

Choose the pipeline implementation that best fits your requirements and infrastructure. Each directory contains detailed instructions on running the pipeline, along with guidelines for preparing input files and accessing results.
